However, as we process more images we potentially have a lot of features from previous timesteps that are still valid. The challenge is to expand the `extract_keypoints_surf(..., refPoints)` function by giving it old reference points. You should then combine your freshly computed features with the old features and remove all duplicates. This requires you to keep track of old features and 3D points.\n",
