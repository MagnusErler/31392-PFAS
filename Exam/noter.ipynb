In stereo vision, for example, rectification can be used to align the images from two cameras so that corresponding points in the two images lie on the same scanline, which makes stereo matching much easier and more accurate.\n","\n","Rectification is typically performed using geometric transformations that map the distorted image to a regular grid or reference image. The type of transformation used depends on the nature and extent of the distortion present in the image. For example, a perspective transformation can be used to correct for the effects of camera position and orientation, while a homography transformation can be used to correct for planar distortions.\n","\n","Overall, image rectification is an important step in many image processing and computer vision applications, as it helps to ensure that images are properly aligned and free of distortions, which can improve the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis and processing."]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
